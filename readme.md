# Team Profile Generator

## Description

The purpose of this project is to generate a team profile page. The page creates an employee card that lists the employee's name, role, id, email, and special characterstic. This team page can be generated quickly by answering command line prompts. While bulding this project I got more practice at implementing npm modules and object oriented programing.
